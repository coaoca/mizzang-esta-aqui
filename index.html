<p><u><strong>Back pain is one of the most common reasons people go to the doctor or miss work, and it is a leading cause of disability worldwide.</strong></u></p>
<p>Fortunately, you can take measures to prevent or relieve most back pain episodes.<br>If prevention fails, simple home treatment and proper body mechanics often will heal your back within a few weeks and keep it functional.</p>

<p><strong>Muscle or ligament strain.</strong> Repeated heavy lifting or a sudden awkward movement can strain back muscles and spinal ligaments.<br>If you're in poor physical condition, constant strain on your back can cause painful muscle spasms.</p>
<p><strong>Bulging or ruptured disks.</strong> Disks act as cushions between the bones in your spine.<br>The soft material inside a disk can bulge or rupture and press on a nerve. However, you can have a bulging or ruptured disk without back pain.</p><p><strong>Arthritis.</strong> Osteoarthritis can affect the lower back. In some cases, arthritis in the spine can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, a condition called spinal stenosis.<br> Your spine's vertebrae can develop painful fractures if your bones become porous and brittle.</p>

<p>You might avoid back pain or prevent its recurrence by improving your physical condition and learning and practicing proper body mechanics.Can increase strength and endurance in your back and allow your muscles to function better. Walking and swimming are good choices.</p>
<p>Build muscle strength and flexibility. Abdominal and back muscle exercises, which strengthen your core, help condition these muscles so that they work together like a natural corset for your back.</p>
<p>Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight strains back muscles. If you're overweight, trimming down can prevent back pain.</p>
