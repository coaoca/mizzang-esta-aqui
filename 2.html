<p>A herniated disk occurs when a portion of the nucleus pushes through a crack in the annulus.<br>Symptoms may occur if the herniation <strong>compresses a nerve.</strong><br>A herniated disk refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions (disks) that sit between the individual bones (vertebrae) that stack to make your spine.</p>
<p>A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center (nucleus) encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior (annulus).<br>Sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk, a herniated disk occurs when <strong>some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus.</strong>
<p>A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, can irritate a nearby nerve.<br>Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can <u>result in <strong>pain, numbness or weakness</strong> in an arm or leg.</u></p><img src="running.jpg" width="35%">

<p>Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk. Surgery is usually not necessary to relieve the problem.</p><br><br>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<u>Most herniated disks occur in the <strong>lower back</strong></u>, although <u>they can also occur in the <strong>neck.<br></strong></u><br><img src="backpain.jpg" width="40%"><img src="neckshoulder.jpg" width="35%">

<br><br>Signs and symptoms depend on where the disk is situated and whether the disk is <u>pressing on a nerve.</u>
<br>They usually affect one side of the body.

<ol><li>Arm or leg pain</li>If your herniated disk is in your lower back, you'll typically <u>feel the most pain in your <strong>buttocks,thigh and calf.</strong></u><br>You might have pain in part of the foot, as well.<br>If your herniated disk is in your neck, you'll typically feel the most pain in your shoulder and arm.<br>This pain might shoot into your arm or leg when you cough, sneeze or move into certain positions.<br><u>Pain is often described as sharp or burning.</u>
<li>Numbness or tingling</li> People who have a herniated disk often <strong>have radiating numbness or tingling</strong> in the body part served by the affected nerves.
<li>Weakness</li>Muscles served by the affected nerves tend to weaken.<br>This can cause you to stumble, or affect your ability to lift or hold items.</ol>
