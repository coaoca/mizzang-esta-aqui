<p>Spinal stenosis is a chronic degenerative condition in which the spaces within the spine narrow, putting pressure on the nerves that travel through the spine.<br>As the discs lose water content and shrink, spurs often form and osteoarthritis develops.<br>The ligaments can also thicken, <u>resulting in a narrowing of the spinal canal where the nerves travel.</u></p>
<p>The condition typically occurs in the lower back (lumbar stenosis) and the neck (cervical stenosis).<br>It progresses with age and usually affects individuals over the age of 50. Treatment for spinal stenosis is based on symptoms and is aimed at reducing inflammation in the area where the spinal cord or nerve roots are constricted. In severe cases, doctors may recommend surgery to create additional space for the spinal cord or nerves.</p><br>
